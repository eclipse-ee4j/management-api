== CHAPTER 1 - 

Introduction

The increasing popularity of the Java _tm_ 2
Enterprise Edition (J2EE _tm_ ) platform has mandated the specification
of a common framework for the delivery of Java enterprise management and
monitoring services . The goal of JSR77 is to abstract the fundemental
manageable aspects of the J2EE architecture to provide a well defined
model for implementing instrumentation and information access. In
addition, this specification defines a standardized API for
interoperating with J2EE _tm_ components that participate in the
monitoring and control of the platform’s resources.

=== Overview

This specification defines a management
information model for the J2EE platform, the J2EE Management Model. This
specification also includes standard mappings of the model to the Common
Information Model (CIM), an SNMP Management Information Base (MIB), and
to a Java API as a server resident Enterprise JavaBeans _tm_ (EJB _TM_ )
component, the J2EE Management EJB (MEJB) component. The MEJB component
provides interoperable remote access to the model from any standard J2EE
application.

=== Scope

The scope of this version of the
specification is limited to the management of J2EE servers, application
components that are deployed onto a J2EE server and resources which
provide the J2EE Standard Services. The scope of the information and
operations required by the specification is limited to that required to
enable basic functionality for the following:

* Discovery - discovering and navigating the
managed objects on a managed system
* Events - receiving notifications of
important events that occur on managed objects
* State - observing and controlling the
running state of managed objects
* Performance - monitoring basic performance
statistics of managed objects

The following management catagories are also
considered important but were deemed out of scope for this version of
the specification:

* Security management
* Accounting
* Configuration management
* Fault Management/Recovery

=== Organization

* Chapter 2 introduces the J2EE Management
Model and provides definitions of the terms used to describe the model.
* Chapter 3 specifies the structure, format,
and semantics of managed objects required by this specification.
* Chapter 4 specifies a standard extensible
event model for the J2EE Management Model.
* Chapter 5 specifies a standard state
management model for the J2EE Management Model.
* Chapter 6 specifies the performance data
requirements of the J2EE Management Model.
* Chapter 7 specifies the J2EE Management EJB
component (MEJB).
* Chapter 8 specifies the SNMP MIB mapping of
the J2EE Management Model.
* Chapter 9 specifies the CIM mapping of the
J2EE Management Model.

== CHAPTER 2 - 

J2EE Management Model

This chapter provides an overview of the J2EE
Management Model and explains how it is applied to managed systems.

=== Overview

The J2EE Management Model is a specification
of the attributes, operations and architecture of the managed objects
required by compliant J2EE platform implementations. The model is
designed to be interoperable with a variety of industry standard
management systems and protocols.



The Management EJB (MEJB) component
(link:management.html#a971[See J2EE Management EJB Component]”)
provides interoperable remote access of the model to J2EE application
components. All compliant implementations must support the MEJB
component.



This specification also provides standard
mappings of the model to the CIM/WBEM Common Information Model (CIM)
(link:management.html#a4785[See J2EE Management CIM]”) and the
SNMP Management Information Base (MIB)
(link:management.html#a1290[See J2EE Management SNMP]”).
Implementation support for SNMP and CIM/WBEM is optional.

=== Elements of the J2EE Management Model

image:management-1.png[image]

=== [[a52]]J2EE Management Model

link:management.html#a52[See J2EE
Management Model] illustrates the elements of the J2EE Management Model.
The shaded sections represent standard extensions of the basic required
models that each managed object may support. The requirements of the
J2EE Management Model are specified by the following chapters:

* link:management.html#a124[See
Managed Objects]link:management.html#a124[See Managed Objects]”
specifies the managed object types required by the J2EE Management
Model. The J2EE product provider must implement the managed objects
described in this chapter.
* link:management.html#a419[See
Events]link:management.html#a419[See Events]” specifies the
EventProvider model which specifies the requirements of managed objects
that support event notification.
* link:management.html#a477[See
State Management]link:management.html#a477[See State
Management]” specifies the StateManageable model which specifies the
requirements of managed objects that support state manipulation.
* link:management.html#a523[See
Performance Monitoring]link:management.html#a523[See
Performance Monitoring]” specifies the StatisticProvider model which
specifies the requirements of managed objects that provide performance
data.

The specification of the models includes the
UML diagrams as well as the textual specification of the metadata.

=== Interpreting the UML Diagrams

The elements specified by the managed object
UML diagrams consist of:

* A name which identifies the managed object
types and supertypes.

The use of supertypes in the managed object
model does not imply the capability of polymorphism. Inheritance in the
models is used simply as a convenient way to express the attributes and
operation requirements shared by a manageable type. The set of standard
J2EE managed object types is limited to the sub-types specified by the
model at the end of the hierarchy of inheritance of a particular model.
The required attributes and operations for each type includes all of the
attributes and operations in the super-types in the hierarchy.
link:management.html#a170[See Managed Object j2eeTypes and
required <parent-j2eeType> keys] lists the standard J2EE managed object
typeslink:management.html#a172[See required parent-j2eeType
keys]link:management.html#a172[See required parent-j2eeType
keys].

* Attributes which contain data about the
managed object.
* All specified attributes must implemented
as readable and may also be implemented as writable. It is
implementation specific which attributes are writable.
* Attributes which identify managed objects
are specified to be of the OBJECT_NAME type. The type identifier
OBJECT_NAME refers to a formatted string whose syntax is defined by the
specification of the _objectName_ attribute of the J2EEManagedObject
model (see link:management.html#a138[See objectName]). The
OBJECT_NAME string type provides a unique identifier for a managed
object within a J2EE management domain. Every managed object has a
_name_ attribute whose value complies with the OBJECT_NAME syntax.
* Operations which describe the functions
required by a managed object type. All operations specified for a
managed object type must be invocable by a management client.

=== Supplier Cardinality

In each of the attributes in the model that
provide a list of managed objects there is also a specification of
supplier cardinality. Supplier cardinality specifies the minimum and
maximum number of items that can be expected to exist in a list.
Supplier cardinality is specified as:



 _min_ .. _max_



Where _min_ can be any whole number and _max_
can be any whole number or an asterisk ‘*’, which indicates that there
is no maximum limit.

=== J2EEApplication managed object example

The following example illustrates how the
J2EE Management Model specification of the J2EEApplication type
translates to accessing a J2EEApplication managed object instance
through an implementation of the J2EE Management EJB(MEJB) component.



The specification for the J2EEApplication
managed object type (link:management.html#a305[See
J2EEApplication extends J2EEDeployedObject]) indicates that
J2EEApplication extends J2EEDeployedObject which extends
J2EEManagedObject (link:management.html#a130[See
J2EEManagedObject]).



This indicates that a managed object instance
of the J2EEApplication type must support at least the following
attributes:

*  _OBJECT_NAME objectName_
*  _boolean stateManageable_
*  _boolean statisticsProvider_
*  _boolean eventProvider_
*  _String deploymentDescriptor_
* OBJECT_NAME server
*  _OBJECT_NAME_ _[] modules_

If any of the boolean attributes is true it
indicates that this J2EEApplication managed object also includes the
additional required attributes and operations of the respective models
StateManageable, StatisticsProvider, or EventProvider.



link:management.html#a90[See] shows
how a J2EE component accesses the attributes of a managed object of the
J2EEApplication type through the MEJB component.



=== [[a90]]

=== // Note: applicationName is the javax.management.ObjectName for the application

//

// get the value of an attribute which is a
primitive type

// in this case, the deployment descriptor
for the application

 String deploymentDescriptor = (String)
mejb.getAttribute(applicationName, "deploymentDescriptor");



// get the OBJECT_NAMEs of the modules for
this application

===  String [] modules = (String[])mejb.getAttribute(applicationName, "modules");



After the component has the array of
OBJECT_NAME strings for all of the J2EEModule managed objects associated
with this application, they can be used to access the attributes and
operations of the modules managed objects the same way they were used to
accessed the application managed object:



=== 

=== // get the deployment descriptors for the modules

 String[] moduleDeploymentDescriptors = new
String[modules.length];

 for (int i=0; i < modules.length; i++) \{

 try \{

 ObjectName moduleName = new
ObjectName(modules[i]);

 moduleDeploymentDescriptors[i] = (String)
mejb.getAttribute(moduleName, "deploymentDescriptor");

 } catch (MalformedObjectNameException e) \{

 }

 }

=== J2EE Product Provider’s Responsibilities

The J2EE Product Provider has the following
responsibilities:

* Provide the instrumentation required by the
J2EE Management Model. The J2EE Product Provider must provide a J2EE
product that provides an accurate representation of the metadata
required by this specification.
* Provide an implementation of the J2EE
Management EJB (MEJB) component. The J2EE Product Provider must provide
a compliant implementation of the MEJB component. The MEJB component may
be automatically deployed during server installation. A compliant J2EE
Product must deploy an MEJB component before installation of that
product can be considered complete.

=== Extending the managed object models

=== Vendor-specific attributes and operations

J2EE Product Providers may extend the
functionallity of any of the models specified by the J2EE Management
Model by adding vendor-specific attributes, operations and associations.
The attributes, operations and associations specified by the models must
always be supported exactly as specified.

=== Vendor-specific managed object types

In addition to the standard specified managed
object types, J2EE Product Providers may include vendor-specific managed
object types in the management system implementation. Vendor-specific
managed object type models must extend the J2EEManagedObject type and
support the attributes required by the J2EEManagedObject model. The
standard managed object types must always be supported exactly as
specified.





== CHAPTER 3 - 

[[a124]]Managed Objects

The term managed object refers to the
definition of a unit of management information. Management
instrumentation provides the “glue” which takes the information
available on an entity to be managed and makes it appear as a collection
of managed objects.



This chapter contains the models and
metamodels that specify the format, semantics and relationship of the
managed objects required by all compliant implementations of this
specification.



Although the diagrams and textual
descriptions that specify the managed object types closely resemble Java
classes, they are not specifications of Java class types or Java class
inheritance hierarchies and do not represent requirements of the class
names or class hierarchies of a particular implementation.

=== J2EEManagedObject[[a130]]

image:J2EEManagedObject.cl.png[image]

=== J2EEManagedObject detail with inheritance overview

The J2EEManagedObject model is the base model
of all managed objects in the J2EE Management Model. All managed objects
in the J2EE platform must include the attributes of the
J2EEManagedObject model. All managed objects must have a unique name.



Any managed object may optionally implement
the metadata specified by the StateManageable model (see
link:management.html#a482[See StateManageable]), which enables
the managed object to provide state management operations.

Any managed object may optionally implement
the metadata specified by the StatisticsProvider model (see
link:management.html#a527[See StatisticsProvider]), which
provides access to the performance statistics for the managed object.

Any managed object may optionally implement
the EventProvider model, which indicates it emits events that implement
the Notification model (see link:management.html#a421[See
EventProvider]).

=== Attribute Detail

=== [[a138]]objectName

===  _OBJECT_NAME objectName_

The object name of the managed object. The
_objectName_ attribute is of the type OBJECT_NAME which is a string that
complies with the syntax specified for a J2EEManagedObject name below.
The _objectName_ attribute must not be null. The value of _objectName_
must be unique within the management domain. Management applications use
this value to identify managed objects, for example identifying the
source of events.



The J2EEManagedObject objectName consists of
two parts:

* A domain name
* An unordered set of key properties, which
must include the _j2eeType_ , _name_ and _<parent-j2eeType>_ key
properties.

The J2EEManagedObject name has the following
syntax:

=== [domainName]:j2eeType=value,name=value,<parent-j2eeType>[,property=value]*

=== Domain Name

The domain name is a case-sensitive string.
It provides a structure for the naming space within a J2EE management
domain. The manner in which the domain name is structured is
application-dependent. The domain name string may contain any
characters, including spaces, except those which are object name
separators or wildcards, namely the colon (:), comma (,), equal sign
(=), asterisk (*) or question mark (?). The domain name is treated as a
whole, therefore any semantic sub-definitions within the string are
opaque to a J2EE Management implementation.

=== Key Property List

The key property list enables you to assign
unique names to the managed objects of a given domain. A key property is
a property-value pair, where the property does not need to correspond to
an actual attribute of a managed object. The key property list must
contain at least the mandatory key properties. It may contain any number
of optional key properties whose order is not significant. Keys and
values are subject to the same character restrictions as domain names.

=== Mandatory Key Properties

The following key properties are required in
the key property list for every managed object name:

*  _j2eeType_ - specifies the J2EE type of
the managed object. The value for _j2eeType_ must be a valid standard
J2EEManagedObject type. link:management.html#a170[See Managed
Object j2eeTypes and required <parent-j2eeType> keys] lists the standard
types. Managed objects with vendor-specific types are permitted to
coexist in the management system. The capabilities of managed objects
with vendor-specific _j2eeType_ values are implementation specific and
are not governed by this specification.
*  _name_ - specifies the name of the
J2EEManagedObject. (for example, _j2eeType=Servlet,name=My Cool Servlet_
). The value of the _name_ key property is arbitrary to the vendors
implementation with the following exception:

The value of the _name_ key property for
managed object instances of the J2EEDomain type must be equivalent to
the domain name of the domain it manages.

* < _parent-j2eeType_ > - specifies key
properties which are derived from the valid managed object types defined
inlink:management.html#a170[See Managed Object j2eeTypes and
required <parent-j2eeType> keys]. The value of a parent-j2eeType key
properties is equal to the value of the name key properties of the
OBJECT_NAME of the parents of this managed object. These standard key
properties provide a simple mechanism to define a hierarchy of managed
object names which will be unique and identifiable. The standard key
properties are defined as follows:

=== <parent-j2eeType>=<parent J2EEManagedObject name>

For example, for a management domain named
“FirstEverBank”, the management system would have a J2EEDomain object
whose _objectName_ is:

=== FirstEverBank:j2eeType=J2EEDomain,name=FirstEverBank

A J2EEServer in this domain could be named as
follows:

=== FirstEverBank:j2eeType=J2EEServer,name=BankServer1

When an application is deployed into the
server, the J2EEApplication could be named as follows:

=== FirstEverBank:j2eeType=J2EEApplication,name=AccountsController,J2EEServer=BankServer1

An EJBModule in the J2EEApplication could be
named as follows:

=== FirstEverBank:j2eeType=EJBModule,name=BankAccount,J2EEApplication=AccountsController,J2EEServer=BankServer1

An Entity Bean in the EJBModule could be
named as follows:

=== FirstEverBank:j2eeType=EntityBean,name=Account,EJBModule=BankAccount,J2EEApplication=AccountsController,J2EEServer=BankServer1

* 

link:management.html#a170[See
Managed Object j2eeTypes and required <parent-j2eeType> keys] lists the
required _<parent-j2eeType>_ key properties for each managed object
type.

=== stateManageable

===  _boolean stateManageable_

If true, indicates that this managed object
implements the StateManageable model and is state manageable by the
specification of link:management.html#a477[See State
Management]”. If false, the managed object does not support state
management.

=== statisticsProvider

===  _boolean statisticsProvider_

If true, indicates that the managed object
supports the generation of performance statistics and implements the
StatisticsProvider model (see link:management.html#a527[See
StatisticsProvider]).

If false, the J2EEManagedObject does not
support performance statistics.

=== eventProvider

===  _boolean eventProvider_

If true, indicates that the managed object
implements the EventProvider model (see
link:management.html#a421[See EventProvider]) and provides
notification about events that occur on that object.



The semantic of the _eventProvider_ attribute
in the context of a J2EEDomain managed object is a special case. If its
value is true, it indicates that the domain supports event notification
and that the J2EEDomain managed object is a central registration point
for event listeners that wish to receive event notification from all
event providers in the domain. When the eventProvider attribute is true,
the J2EEDomain managed object must emit all events from all event
providers in the domain.

In addition, when the value of the
_eventProvider_ attribute of a J2EEDomain is true, the J2EEDomain
managed object must emit the _j2ee.object.created_ and
_j2ee.object.deleted_ event types (see
link:management.html#a449[See type]).

=== J2EEDomain _extends J2EEManagedObject_

== CHAPTER 4 - 

[[a419]]Events

This chapter specifies a standard extensible
event model for the J2EE Management Model. Events notify management
applications that need to react to state changes and specific conditions
that occur in the platform containers and services.

=== [[a421]]EventProvider

image:EventProvider.cl.png[image]

=== EventProvider

The EventProvider model specifies the
_eventTypes_ attribute, which must be implemented by all managed objects
that emit events.

=== Attribute Detail

=== eventTypes

===  _String [] eventTypes_

A list of the types of events the managed
object emits. The contents of the list are type strings, as specified in
link:management.html#a449[See type].

=== Notification

image:management-14.png[image]

=== Notification

The Notification model specifies the
attributes that must be included in every event generated by the
management system. A Notification includes:

* The name of the source managed object
* A timestamp
* a sequence number
* a string that identifies its type
* a message that provides additional
information about the event
* optional vendor specific user data.

All management systems that support event
notification must support all of the attributes of the Notification
model. All events that are generated on behalf of managed objects that
are part of or extend the J2EE Management Model must provide valid data
for each of the attributes specified by the Notification model.

=== Attribute Detail

=== source

===  _OBJECT_NAME source_

The name of the managed object that generated
this event. The value of the source attribute must be equal to the
OBJECT_NAME of the managed object from which the event originated.

* 

=== timeStamp

===  _long timeStamp_

The time of the event represented as a long,
whose value is the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970,
00:00:00.

=== sequenceNumber

===  _long sequenceNumber_

The sequence number of the event. Identifies
the position of the event in a stream of events. The sequence number
provides a means of determining the order of sequential events that
occurred with the same timestamp within the minimum supported unit of
time. The scope of the sequence number is the source of the event.

=== [[a449]]type

===  _String type_

The type of an event, not to be confused with
its Java class, is the characterization of a generic event object. The
type is assigned by the source object and conveys the semantic meaning
of a particular event. The type is given as a string, which is
interpreted as any number of dot-separated components. This allows some
structure in the naming of event types.



All strings prefixed by “j2ee.” are reserved
for the standard events defined by this specification. Otherwise, event
sources are free to define all types they wish to use when naming the
events they emit. All of the event types emitted by an event provider
must be listed in the eventTypes attribute.



Standard event types are:

*  _j2ee.object.created_ - a new managed
object was created.
*  _j2ee.object.deleted_ - a managed object
was deleted.
*  _j2ee.state.starting_ - a state manageable
object entered the starting state.
*  _j2ee.state.running_ - a state manageable
object entered the running state.
*  _j2ee.state.stopping_ - a state manageable
object entered the stopping state.
*  _j2ee.state.stopped_ - a state manageable
object entered the stopped state.
*  _j2ee.state.failed_ - a state manageable
object entered the failed state.
*  _j2ee.attribute.changed_ - an attribute
has change value

=== message

===  _String message_

An informational message about the event.

=== userData

===  _Object userData_

Optional data the notification broadcaster
wishes to communicate to listeners. The content of the data is
vendor-specific. The userData attribute may be null.

=== Event Notification

Most management systems specify an event
notification mechanism. Implementations of the J2EE Management Model by
management systems that support event notification must deliver events
that implement the Notification model.



Management tools that interoperate with these
management systems and their protocols receive events through the
delivery mechanisms specified by the management system being
incorporated.

=== javax.management.Notification

All implementations of this specification,
which deliver a Java object as an instance of an event notification,
must emit event objects which are instances of the class
_javax.management.Notification_ as specified by the Java Management
Extensions Instrumentation and Agent Specification (JSR003). The the
value of the attributes in any instance of
_javax.management.Notification_ emitted by a managed object type
specified by the J2EE Management Model must be exactly as specified in
this chapter.

== CHAPTER 5 - 

[[a477]]State Management

This chapter specifies a standard state
management model for the J2EE Management Model. State management refers
to the management facilities that are provided by compliant J2EE
platforms to manage the state of a J2EE platform and the components that
comprise it. The management facilities allow Management Applications to
get the current state of the platform and its components, find out how
long the platform and components have been running, and start and stop
the platform components.







=== [[a482]]StateManageable

image:StateManageable.cl.png[image]

=== StateManageable

The StateManageable model specifies the
operations and attributes that must be implemented by a managed object
that supports state management. A managed object that implements the
StateManageable model is termed a State Manageable Object (SMO). An SMO
generates events when its state changes.

=== Attribute Detail

=== state

===  _int state_

The current state of this SMO.

image:state_diagram.st.png[image]

=== StateManageable object state diagram



The SMO can be in one of the following states
(see the Event Model for details of the events):



=== STARTING (0)

This state indicates that the SMO has been
requested to start, and is in the process of starting. On entering this
state an SMO may generate an event whose type value is “
_j2ee.state.starting_ ”. Event notification of the STARTING state is
optional for all managed objects that implement StateManageable.



=== RUNNING (1)

This is the normal running state for an SMO.
This state indicates that the SMO is operational. On entering this state
an SMO must generate an event whose type value is “ _j2ee.state.running_
”. Event notification of the RUNNING state is required for all managed
objects that implement StateManageable.



=== STOPPING (2)

This state indicates that the SMO has been
requested to stop, and is in the process of stopping. On entering this
state an SMO may generate an event whose type value is “
_j2ee.state.stopping_ ”. Event notification of the STOPPING state is
optional for all managed objects that implement StateManageable.





=== STOPPED (3)

This state indicates that the StateManageable
Object has stopped and can be restarted. On entering this state an SMO
must generate an event whose type value is “ _j2ee.state.stopped_ ”.
Event notification of the STOPPED state is required by all managed
objects that implement StateManageable.





=== FAILED (4)

This state indicates that the StateManageable
Object has unexpectedly stopped. On entering this state an SMO must
generate an event whose type value is “ _j2ee.state.failed_ ”. Event
notification of the FAILED state is required by all managed objects that
implement StateManageable. It may be possible to start an SMO that has
entered the FAILED state by calling the _start()_ operation. It may be
possible to stop an SMO that has entered the FAILED state by calling the
_stop()_ operation. An SMO that cannot succesfully reach the RUNNING or
STOPPED state from the FAILED state must reenter the FAILED state after
the the attempt to reach the RUNNING or STOPPED state fails and emit
another “ _j2ee.state.failed_ ” event. An SMO that cannot succesfully
reach the RUNNING or STOPPED state from the FAILED state requires
intervention, such as redeployment, to restore the managed object to the
desired state.

=== startTime

===  _long startTime_

The time that the managed object was started
(i.e. entered the RUNNING state) represented as a long, which value is
the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00.

=== Operation Detail

=== start

===  _void start()_

Starts the SMO. This operation can be invoked
only when the SMO is in the STOPPED or FAILED state. It causes the SMO
to go into the STARTING state initially, and if it completes
successfully, the SMO will be in the RUNNING state. Note that _start()_
is not called on any of the child SMOs that are registered with this
SMO; it is the responsibility of the calling application to start the
child SMO if this is required.

=== startRecursive

===  _void startRecursive()_

Starts the SMO. This operation can only be
invoked when the SMO is in the STOPPED or FAILED state. It causes the
SMO to go into the STARTING state initially, and if it completes
successfully, the SMO will be in the RUNNING state. The operation
_startRecursive()_ is called on all the child SMOs registered with this
SMO that are in the STOPPED or FAILED state.

=== stop

===  _void stop()_

Stops the SMO. This operation can only be
invoked when the SMO is in the RUNNING or STARTING state. It causes
_stop()_ to be called on all the child SMOs registered with this SMO
that are in the RUNNING or STARTING state. It is mandatory if an SMO is
in the STOPPED or FAILED state, that all its child SMOs must also be in
the STOPPED or FAILED state, therefore there is no _stopRecursive()_
operation. Invoking _stop()_ causes the SMO to go into the STOPPING
state initially, and if it completes successfully, the SMO and all the
child SMOs will be in the STOPPED state.

== CHAPTER 6 - 

[[a523]]Performance Monitoring

This chapter describes the Performance Data
Framework, which specifies a performance data model as well as
performance data requirements of the J2EE Management Model.

=== Performance Data Framework

The Performance Data Framework consists of
the StatisticsProvider model, which any managed object may implement,
the Stats interfaces, which specify standard performance attribute
semantics for each managed object type, and the Statistic interfaces
which provide specific interfaces for representing the common
performance data types.

=== [[a527]]StatisticsProvider

image:StatisticsProvider.cl.png[image]

=== StatisticsProvider

The StatisticsProvider model must be
implemented by all managed objects that provide perfomance data. A
managed object that implements the StatisticsProvider model must have
its _statisticProvider_ attribute set to "true".



The _stats_ attribute references the specific
Stats interface that corresponds to the managed object type that is
providing Statistics. For example, an EntityBean managed object that
implements StatisticsProvider will have a reference in the _stats_
attribute to an object that implements the EntityBeanStats interface.
The detail for the _stats_ attribute includes a table of the appropriate
Stats interface that each managed object must implement if it provides
performance data.

=== Attribute Detail

=== stats

===  _Stats stats_

Provides access to the implementation of the
specific Stats interface that this managed object is required to support
if it implements the StatisticProvider model.
link:management.html#a536[See Stats interface requirements]
shows the Stats interface required by each managed object type. See
link:management.html#a669[See Stats] for details about support

specify performance data accessors for each of the specific managed
object types. The data required by the interfaces is commonly available
on all platform implementations. Managed objects that support statistics
are permitted to provide support for a subset of the accessors in the
Stats interfaces. Managed objects indicate which of the specified
accessors return valid data by including only the names of the supported
statistics in the statisticNames list. The data provided by a supported

== CHAPTER 7 - 

[[a971]]J2EE Management EJB
Component

The J2EE Management EJB component (MEJB)
provides interoperable access to the J2EE Management Model from any J2EE
component on all platforms that implement the J2EE Management
specification. The MEJB component incorporates the Java Management
Extensions (JMX) API, a standard framework for Java object
instrumentation.



The MEJB component exposes the managed
objects on any J2EE platform as JMX manageable resources as defined by
the Java Management Extensions Instrumentation and Agent Specification
(JSR003). The MEJB component provides local and remote access of the
platform’s manageable resources through the EJB interoperability
protocol.

=== MEJB Implementation requirements

All compliant J2EE products must provide an
implementation of an Enterprise Session bean component which implements
the interfaces specified in this chapter. The MEJB component may be
automatically deployed during server installation. A compliant J2EE
product must deploy an MEJB component before installation of that
product can be considered complete.



The MEJB component provides access to the
managed object instances of all the available managed objects in one or
more management domains. Compliant implementations of the MEJB component
must provide access to all managed object instances required by the J2EE
Management Model. All attributes required by the J2EE Management Model
for a standard J2EE managed object type must be accessible from the MEJB
component. All operations required by the J2EE Management Model for a
standard J2EE managed object type must be invokable from the MEJB
component.

=== JMX requirements

The MEJB component exposes the manageable
resources on a J2EE platform as JMX Managed Beans (MBeans) and requires
an implementation of the JMX public APIs specified by the Java
Management Extensions Instrumentation and Agent Specification, v1.1.

=== Remote Interface

The interface
_javax.management.j2ee.Management_ is the standard remote interface for
the MEJB component. The remote interface of the MEJB component
implementation must be _javax.management.j2ee.Management_ or a
subinterface of _javax.management.j2ee.Management._

=== Home Interface

The interface
_javax.management.j2ee.ManagementHome_ is the standard home interface
for the MEJB component. The home interface of the MEJB component
implementation must be _javax.management.j2ee.ManagementHome_ or a
subinterface of _javax.management.j2ee.ManagementHome_ . The _create()_
method specified by the _ManagementHome_ interface must return a session
object that provides access to the entire managed object hierarchy.

=== Naming Requirements

It is recommended that the home interface for
the MEJB component be named in the _ejb/mgmt_ subcontext. It is
recommended that a default name of _ejb/mgmt/MEJB_ be used whenever
possible.

=== Event Listener Requirements

Management applications that wish to receive
events must register an event listener object that implements the
_javax.management.NotificationListener_ interface specified in the Java
Management Extensions Instrumentation and Agent Specification (JSR003).



It is not explicitly required that all event
listeners communicate with remote objects, since internal listeners may
operate in the same Java VM. In most cases, the event listener
registered by the management application will need to receive events
from a remote object in order to interoperate with the managed system.



It is the responsibility of the
implementation of the _ListenerRegistration_ interface returned by the
MEJB _getListenerRegistry()_ method to implement the appropriate
mechanism to receive events from the management system and deliver them
to the event listener registered by the client.



The implementation of the
_ListenerRegistration_ interface is a system value class produced by the
J2EE product provider and must obey the interoperability requirements
for value classes as specified in the Enterprise JavaBeans
specification, “Support for Distrubution and Interoperability” section.



link:management.html#a998[See Event
delivery] illustrates the event delivery paradigm. The listener
connector and listener proxy are presented as conceptual types for the
proprietary event delivery mechanism supported by a hypothetical
implementation of an MEJB. The transport mechanism for remote delivery
is also implementation-specific and may use services provided by the
J2EE platform such as JMS or RMI.

== CHAPTER 8 - 

[[a1290]]J2EE Management SNMP

This chapter defines a portion of the
Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network and systems
management protocols in the Internet community. More specifically, it
describes a set of managed objects that allow for the monitoring of the
Jave 2 Enterprise Edition Platform.

=== Introduction

As part of the Java Community Process (see
http://www.jcp.org/), JSR 77 was formed to define a management
information model for the Java 2 Enterprise Edition Platform, the J2EE
Management Model. The J2EE Management Model is a UML model which
describes the structure, format, and semantics of management data for
the J2EE Platform.



 This chapter defines a portion of the
Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
protocols in the Internet community which is consistent with that model
as well as with the Structure of Management Information defined for the
SNMP Management Framework.



 The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”,
“REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”,
“MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as
described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

=== The SNMP Management Framework

 The SNMP Management Framework presently
consists of five major components:

* An overall architecture, described in RFC
2571 [RFC2571].
* Mechanisms for describing and naming
objects and events for the purpose of management. The first version of
this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and
described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and
RFC 1215 [RFC1215]. The second version, called SMIv2, is described in
STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC
2580 [RFC2580].
* Message protocols for transferring
management information. The first version of the SNMP message protocol
is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second
version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]
and RFC 1906 [RFC1906]. The third version of the message protocol is
called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572]
and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].
* Protocol operations for accessing
management information. The first set of protocol operations and
associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A
second set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
described in RFC 1905 [RFC1905].
* A set of fundamental applications described
in RFC 2573 [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism
described in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

 A more detailed introduction to the current
SNMPv3 Management Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570]. A
framework, termed the AgentX framework, which extends the SNMP
Management Framework and can accommodate environments wherein multiple
components might need to have a shared mechanism for sending and
receiving SNMP protocol messages, is described in RFC 2741 [RFC2741].



 In SNMP, managed objects are accessed via a
virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or
MIB. Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
SMI.



 This chapter specifies a MIB module that is
compliant to the SMIv2. A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced
through the appropriate translations. Some machine readable information
in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the
translation process. However, this loss of machine readable information
is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.

=== Overview

 The J2EE MIB module defined in this chapter
can be used to discover and monitor details about J2EE servers. The
status of the server and its components is reported as MIB objects which
can be polled, and MAY also be reported as traps. OPTIONAL performance
statistics are also defined.



 The J2EE management model allows multiple
servers on a single node as well as single servers spanning multiple
nodes. The MIB is defined and indexed in support of this, and permits
many but not all alternatives in agent and instrumentation
architectures; these MAY be based on either monolithic or AgentX-like
SNMP frameworks. All of the following are supported:

* Components of different multi-node servers
may coexist on a node, from one or more vendors.
* The agent (or AgentX master agent, or, less
likely, the AgentX subagent) might reside on a node which does not host
any component of a server.
* A J2EE management domain (part of the J2EE
management model) can span multiple servers and therefore multiple
nodes.
* Servers and domains may share nodes with
other SNMP-managed components.
* An AgentX-like master agent might be
present, with sessions to one or more subagents having access to a
server’s instrumentation.

 An SNMP agent (or agentx-like subagent)
supporting this MIB MUST assemble and present an integrated view of any
server, whether single node or multi-node, for which it has created a
row in the server table (j2eeSrvTable).

=== The Structure of the MIB

 The following guidelines were followed for
the MIB:

* Managed object types from the model become
conceptual tables
* Some attribute lists for certain managed
object types also become conceptual tables
* Attributes inherited from supertypes become
conceptual columns in tables for all managed object types inheriting
that attribute
* Key property lists used to assign unique
names to managed objects become the indices into a conceptual table
entry
* Events are mapped into traps
* State management is embedded into the
individual tables
* The Performance Data Framework become
augmentations of conceptual tables (or were embedded into the tables
directly in cases where the table was specific to a particular managed
object); those augmentations (or their embedded equivalents) are
organized into object groups which are referenced in module compliance
macros in the definition of what subsets of the MIB may be implemented
while still conforming to this definition.
* Truth values indicate on a per-table basis
at runtime whether an optional feature (events, state management,
performance statistics) is supported.
* Only a subset of J2EE management events are
issued as traps. No creation, deletion, or attribute changes are
reported as traps. Only “core” (see J2eeSMState) state changes are
issued, and only for servers, resources, entity beans, and
message-driven beans.
*

 DESCRIPTION

 "This MIB module defines a set of objects
for monitoring

 the J2EE platform."

 REVISION "200107020000Z" -- July 2, 2001

 DESCRIPTION

 "Initial version, for expert group review."

 REVISION "200112170000Z" -- December 17,
2001

 DESCRIPTION

 "Revised version, for public review.

 Updates include the following:

 - Added domains, nodes, JVMs.

 - Dropped more detailed tables for resources
whose

 instrumentation was eliminated from the
model.

 - Clarified that state-manageable objects
which are

 stopped can be restarted.

 - Introduced a textual convention for
managed object names.

 - MIB was made private to JCP.org; it can be
re-rooted when

 published as RFC.

 - Section 5 added.

 - Introductory sections fleshed out.

 - Added Enterprise numbers for Domains,
Servers, JVMs, to

 make vendor checks more authoritative for
JSR77 clients.

 - Added NOTIFICATION-TYPEs (but left OBJECT
list empty).

 - Some generic managed object and state
manageable attributes

 left unexpanded.

 - Still missing JVM, JDBC, and JMS
performance statistics;

 left inconsistent the fact that sometimes
augmentation is

 used, sometimes the objects are just
embedded in the table.

 - Still missing conformance and compliance
information.

 "

 REVISION "200203050000Z" -- March 5, 2002

 DESCRIPTION

 "Revised version, corrected for syntax
checking.

 - Removed all references to Nodes.

 - Filled all replicated OBJECT-TYPES
corresponding to

 J2EEManagedObject attributes.

 - Added conformance statements.

 - Filled OBJECTS list in NOTIFICATION-TYPES

 - Replaced AUGMENTS clauses by INDEX - as
the intended

 purpose seemed to define a 1-[0..1]
relationship

 rather than a 1-1 relationship.

 - Slightly reorganized the OID tree
structure.

 - All Statistics now defined as separate
tables.

 - Added some Revisit: tags when in doubt.

 Revised by Daniel.Fuchs@sun.com

 "

 REVISION "200203080000Z" -- March 8, 2002

 DESCRIPTION "

 - Corrected the NOTIFICATION-TYPE OIDs to
bring them

 in conformance to RFC 2576 (coexistence
draft).

 "

 REVISION "200204160000Z" -- April 16, 2002

 DESCRIPTION

 "Revised version, included missing
performance statistics.

 - Separated EJB stats as different tables as
per EJB

 type. In future will be useful in extending
the EJB

 stats and avoid redundant information.

 - Added JCA connection and connection pool
stat tables.

 - Added JDBC connection and connection pool
stat tables.

 - Added JMS sessions, producer, consumer
stat tables.

 - Added JVM stat table.

 - Removed j2eeDomIndex(redundant data) from
all tables

 except j2eeDomTable and j2eeSrvTable.

 - Changed j2eeSrvVersion access from
read-create to

 read-only

 - Added j2eeJVMNode to j2eeJVMTable

 - Changed syntax of ’Enterprise’ attribute
in tables

 from Integer32 to OBJECT IDENTIFIER, incline
to SNMP

 standard.

 - Bug fix: j2eeSrvVersion added to the
J2eeSrvEntry

 sequence

--------------------------------------------------------------------------





 J2eeMoName ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

 STATUS current

 DESCRIPTION "

 A textual identifier used for names of J2EE
Managed

 Objects.





 To facilitate internationalization, a
J2eeMoName

 is represented using the ISO/IEC IS 10646-1
character

 set, encoded as an octet string using the
UTF-8

 transformation format described in
[RFC2279].





 A J2eeMoName cannot be null, and cannot
contain a

 colon (’:’), comma (’,’), equal sign (’=’),
asterisk

 (’*’), or question mark (’?’).

 "

 SYNTAX OCTET STRING (SIZE (1..255))





 J2eeSMState ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

 STATUS current

 DESCRIPTION "

 The operational status of a
’StateManageable’

 object within the JSR77 model. Six states

 are possible. The three core states are

 RUNNING, STOPPED, and FAILED. Extended
states

 are STARTING, STOPPING, and OTHER. Core
states

 MUST be supported; extended states SHOULD be

 supported.





 RUNNING is the normal operational status of

 a StateManageable object. It indicates that

 the StateManageable object is fully
operational

 from the perspective of the JSR77 model.
Thus

 requests on MIB objects associated with this

 StateManageable object will return results
as

 defined by the JSR77 model.





 STOPPED indicates that the associated

 StateManageable object is quiescent,
inactive,

 or nonexistent. It also indicates that the

 associated object can be restarted. Requests

 on MIB objects associated with this
StateManageable

 object will return results as defined by the

 JSR77 model.





 FAILED is exactly the same as STOPPED except
that

 the StateManageable object has become
stopped

 for unexpected reasons, and some form of

 intervention, perhaps out-of-band, is
required.





 STARTING indicates that the associated

 StateManageable object has begun the process

 of becoming fully operational. This state

 indicates that the StateManageable object is

 in a setup or initialization phase, and

 consequently has undefined behavior from the

 perspective of the JSR77 model. Requests on

 MIB objects associated with this
StateManageable

 object may return valid results, invalid
results,

 or errors.





 STOPPING indicates that the associated

 StateManageable object has begun the process

 of becoming quiescent, inactive, or
nonexistent.

 Requests on MIB objects associated with this

 StateManageable object may return valid
results,

 invalid results, or errors.





 OTHER means none of the above apply.

=== IANA Considerations

 The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
(IANA) is responsible for maintaining a MIB module which provides OID
registrations for well-known languages. The IANA language registry is
intented to reduce interoperability problems by providing a single list
of well-known languages. However, it is of course still possible to
register languages in private OID spaces. Registering languages in
private spaces is especially attractive if a language is used for
experimentation or if a language is only used in environments where the
distribution of MIB modules with the language registration does not
cause any maintenance problems.



 Any additions or changes to the list of
languages registered via IANA require Designated Expert Review as
defined in the IANA guidelines [RFC2434]. The Designated Expert will be
selected by the IESG Area Director for the IETF Operations and
Management Area.

=== Security Considerations

 SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure
environment. Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using
IPSec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed
to access and GET (read) the objects in this MIB.



 It is recommended that the implementers
consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
Specifically, the use of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574
[RFC2574] and the View-based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is
recommended.



 It is a customer/user responsibility to
ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is
properly configured to give access to the objects only to those
principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET them.



 There are no management objects defined in
this MIB that have a MAX- ACCESS clause of read-write and/or
read-create. If this MIB is implemented correctly, then there is no risk
that an intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
via direct SNMP SET operations.



 It is possible that some information,
particularly in the j2eeRsrcTable, might be considered sensitive. It is
thus important to control even GET access to these objects and possibly
to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them over the
network via SNMP. Not all implementations of SNMP provide features for
such a secure environment.

=== Intellectual Property

 The IETF takes no position regarding the
validity or scope of any intellectual property or other rights that
might be claimed to pertain to the implementation or use of the
technology described in this chapter or the extent to which any license
under such rights might or might not be available; neither does it
represent that it has made any effort to identify any such rights.
Information on the IETF’s procedures with respect to rights in
standards-track and standards-related documentation can be found in
BCP-11. Copies of claims of rights made available for publication and
any assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an
attempt made to obtain a general license or permission for the use of
such proprietary rights by implementors or users of this specification
can be obtained from the IETF Secretariat.



 The IETF invites any interested party to
bring to its attention any copyrights, patents or patent applications,
or other proprietary rights which may cover technology that may be
required to practice this standard. Please address the information to

== CHAPTER 9 - 

J2EE Management CIM[[a4785]] __

===  _Introduction_

 _The CIM model for J2EE management is a
standard specification of the DTMF CIM model known as
CIM_Application-J2eeAppServer. This chapter describes the CIM model for
J2EE Managed Objects (applications, modules, servers etc), events, state
management and statistics. It is optional for J2EE platform
implementations to provide a CIM/WBEM implementation of this
specification. Implementations that support CIM/WBEM must comply with
the CIM model specified in this chapter._

 __ 

 _The Managed Object Format (MOF) and UML
representation of the model are available at
http://www.dmtf.org/standards/cim._

===  _Managed Objects_

 _This section deals with modelling basic
managed objects such as J2EE servers, applications, modules, resources._



===  _J2EEDomain_

 _A domain identifies the scope of the J2EE
managed object. As defined in the specification, an instance of
J2EEDomain type must be equivalent to the name of the domain it manages.
CIM_J2eeDomain is a subclass of CIM_AdminDomain, which inherits from
CIM_System._

===  _J2EEServer_

 _The J2EE Server is a complex system of
applications, modules, resources etc. It can be modelled as a subclass
of CIM_System called CIM_J2eeServer._



 _A J2EE server is associated with multiple
Java Virtual Machines, nodes, applications, modules and resources._

 __ 

===  _J2EEApplication_

 _A J2EE application is a software entity
that is installed on a J2EEServer. An application has two aspects to it
- one is the installation/deployment aspect (static) and the second is
the runtime aspect._



 _The installed/deployment aspect is not
addressed in this JSR 077, but will be included as part of JSR 088, J2EE
Application Deployment._



 _The runtime/deployed aspect of a J2EE
application is modeled in CIM as a J2eeApplication, which is a subclass
of the abstract J2EE_DeployedObject class. The J2EE_DeployedObject class
is a subclass of CIM_Service and is provided to allow for both
J2eeApplication objects as well as J2eeModule objects. An application
can be decomposed into the underlying modules that comprise the
application. The modules themselves are subclasses of
J2EE_DeployedObject because they can be deployed independent of an J2EE
application and associated with multiple J2EE applications. A
J2eeApplication is comprised of a number of J2eeModule(s) and this fact
is captured by the CIM_ServiceComponet association. An example of a
module would be the EJBModule which could be represented as the leaf
level subclass of J2eeModule._

===  _J2EEResource_

 _A resource is utilized by a server to
provide standard services. A J2EEResource is represented by class
CIM_J2eeResource which is a subclass of CIM_Service. This is an abstract
class which has concrete subclasses CIM_J2eeJMSResource,
CIM_J2eeJNDIResource, CIM_J2eeJDBCResource etc._



 _These resource classes are associated with
a J2eeServer through an aggregated association, J2EEResourceOnServer._

===  _Events_

===  _Overview of CIM/WBEM Events_

 _The CIM meta model allows special
‘Indication’ types to represent events that may be delivered to
subscribers. All indications inherit from the CIM indication class,
CIM_Indication. The CIM Indications are split into Life Cycle
Indications and Process Indications._



 _‘Life Cycle Indications’ which are created
when CIM classes are created, modified and deleted as well as when
instances of CIM classes are created, modified, deleted, read and have
methods invoked on them. Process Indications are used to represent
indications that cannot be expressed as Life Cycle Indications. The CIM
indication class that represents these indications is referred to as
CIM_ProcessIndication. The DMTF has defined SNMP traps as sub classes of
CIM_ProcessIndication._



 _The subscription process in WBEM consists
of associating an instance of CIM_IndicationFilter (which specifies the
indications of interest) with a CIM_IndicationHandler (which represents
the destination). A subscriber may create instances of a filter and
handler or may choose to instances which already exists. In CIM
associating two or more instances is performed by creating an instance
of the appropriate association class. In this case, an instance of a
CIM_IndicatonSubscription association is created to associate the filter
and destination._



 _More details of the CIM Event model can be
found at http://www.dmtf.org/ education/whitepapers.php_

===  _Modeling J2EE Events in CIM_

 _In order to model J2EE Events, we introduce
a subclass of CIM_ProcessIndication called CIM_J2eeNotification. This
subclass has the properties defined in J2EE Management Event with the
same semantics._

* 

===  _Handling subscriptions_

 _As described above, a subscription is
activated when the CIM_IndicationFilter instance is associated to the
CIM_IndicationHandler instance. The Query string property within
CIM_IndicationFilter specifies what particular indications are of
interest. A query in the WQL query language would typically consist of
boolean conditions on the properties of the J2eeNotification class as
well as the properties of the referenced J2eeManagedObject (which is
stored in the SourceInstance property as per the MOF). Following is a
concrete example:_

===  _select SourceInstance from J2EE_Indication where J2eeNotification.Type = ‘STATE’ and J2eeNotification.SourceInstance.Name = ‘EJB125’_

 _The above filter requests the source
instance from J2EE Notifications whose type is STATE (i.e. these are
state manageable events) from the J2eeManagedObject named EJB125. An
implementation mapping CIM to J2EE events may add an Event Listener to
the appropriate managed object. Once the J2EEEvent is received by the
listener can be mapped to a J2EE_Indication and delivered to the
destination specified by the CIM_IndicationHandler instance._

=== Acknowledgments

The JSR-77 expert group would like to thank
Guru Bhat and Richard Spellman from Sun Microsystems and Reinhold
Kautzleben from SAP for the development of the original _CIM mapping of
the J2EE Management Model._



The JSR-77 expert group would like to thank
the DMTF Application Server subgroup of the DMTF Applications work group
for producing the official version of the CIM_ApplicationServer model
which was introduced in CIM 2.8. __
